# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Piotr Jarnecki

## About Me

Greetings! I'm Piotr Jarnecki, a dedicated software tester with a solid foundation in ISTQB principles.
I specialize in Java and JavaScript, utilizing them to harness the full potential of test automation. I have a fervent enthusiasm for learning and implementing cutting-edge testing methodologies. My toolkit boasts proficiency in Java-centric tools such as Selenium, JUnit, CSS Selectors, and XPATH, with a growing mastery of Cucumber for behavior-driven development.

In the collaborative landscape, I navigate seamlessly through tools like Confluence, JIRA, and Trello, ensuring effective communication and streamlined project management. Additionally, I'm in the process of mastering build automation with Maven and Gradle, further enhancing the efficiency of Java-based testing workflows.
Outside the realm of software testing, I'm an avid enthusiast of tennis, geopolitics, and automotive mechanics.
